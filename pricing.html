<p><b>Enterprise - Contact Us</b></br>
The Enterprise version of the service is for large schools, schools with particular data retention requirements,
or schools with particular data needs.  The data for Enterprise customers is kept in a separate database
and data can be streamed to customer analytics data systems
using Caliper or XAPI protocols.  Because Enterprise customers have their own database, it is easy to migrate
app stores to/from on-premises hosted application stores.  Please contact us at <b>info@learnxp.com</b>
for details on the Enterprise version of this service.
