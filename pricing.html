<p><b>Enterprise - Contact Us</b></br>
The Enterprise version of the service is for large schools, schools with particular data retention requirements,
or schools with particular data needs.  Enterprise schools will have access to their own administrative panel and
will be able to issue their own keys and monitor/control their usage across many instructors.
The data for Enterprise customers is kept in a separate database
and data can be live streamed to customer analytics data systems
using Caliper or XAPI protocols.  Because Enterprise customers have their own database, it is easy to migrate
app stores to/from on-premises hosted application stores.  Please contact us at <b>info@learnxp.com</b>
for details on the Enterprise version of this service.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Data Retention</h1>
<p>
The data and usage for each course is tracked separately.
A course is defined as "active" when students are logging
into the course.   If an instructor or administrator
(enterprise) logs into a course, it does not count as "active".
Instructors or administrators (enterprise) can choose manually
remove inactive course data before the data is automatically
expired.
</p>
<p>
When data expires or is manually removed, this service does
not retain a copy of the data.   By only keeping active data
in the system, we reduce the overall amount of
'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) on the system at any time.
We feel that this active expiry of data is essential to complying with the spirit
and intention of the The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and
EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations.
