<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p>
This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.
</p>
<p><b>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?</b></p>
<p>
When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address or other details to help you with your experience.   If you are paying with a credit card we retain your credit card information only for the purposes of billing your account.
</p>
<p><b>When do we collect information?</b></p>
<p>
We may use the information we collect from you when you register, sign up for paid services, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features.
</p>
<p><b>How do we protect your information?</b></p>
<p>
Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
</p>
<p><b>Do we use 'cookies'?</b></p>
<p>
Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
</p>
<p><b>We use cookies to:</b></p>
<p>
Understand and save user's preferences and identity for future visits and gather analytics
data that is only used to monitor and improve the site.
<p>
Many of the learning applications hosted on these systems are designed to neither use nor
require cookies and will have full function even when cookies are turned off when the
application is launched from a Learning Management System.
</p>
<p><b>If users disable cookies in their browser:</b></p>
<p>
If you turn cookies off, Some of the features that make your site experience more efficient may not function properly.
Many of the learning tools will continue to work without cookies.
</p>
<p><b>Third-party disclosure</b></p>
<p>
We do not and never will sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.
</p>
<p><b>Third-party links</b></p>
<p>
We do not and never will include or offer third-party products or services on our website.
</p>
<p><b>Advertising</b></p>
<p>
We do not and never will have third-party advertising on this site.
</p>
<p><b>Google Analytics</b></p>
<p>
We use Google analytics to track usage and improve the site.
</p>
Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to support analytics on our site. Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by using the Google-provided opt-out capabilities. If users opt-out of Google Analytics on this site, there is no reduction in functionality of this site.
<p>
<p><b>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</b></p>
</p>
We honor Do Not Track signals.  When DNT is indicated, we supress the gathering
of all internal analytics data and do not use any third part analytics on
the pages the user visits.  We never show ads.
<p>
<p><b>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</b></p>
</p>
We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
<p>
<p><b>Data Retention</b></p>
<p>
We actively expire inactive data based on a schedule determined by the service level that the customer
selects.   Customers can choose to expire data earlier on a course by course basis.
When data expires or is manually removed, this service does not retain a copy of the data.   By only keeping active data
in the system, we reduce the overall amount of 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) on the system at any time.
</p>
<p><b>Data Analysis</b></p>
<p>
We will limit our analysis of PII data to reports requested by the customer or reports that are necessary
for billing, accounting, technical support, and overall statistics for the system.  We may do data analysis
to improve the techical relaibility, functionality, or performace of the system.
In particular we will <b>not</b> do any data mining or use Artifical Intelligence techniques to attempt
to sell our services or any other products.
</p>
<p><b>Notifications</b></p> 
<p>
In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will notify you via email
</p>
<p><b>General Philosphy</b></p>
<p>
It is often said that if you are not paying for a service, then you are the product.
For this service, you are not the product and your data/activity is not the product.  We retain
only as much of your data as is needed to accomplish your teaching and learning goals
and for no other purpose.  Wherever possible, we give you direct control over the retention
of your data and respect your wishes with respect to the retention of your data.
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to comply both with the letter and spirit or privacy laws
like the The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and 
EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations.  We aspire to
a company that far exceeds the minimum requirements of these laws.
</p>
<p>
Much of the software used in this company is open source so you can examine/audit
what we are doing with respect to privacy and potentially help us improve our
approaches to this very important topic.
